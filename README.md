# Project Title: User Experience Assessment of the IBI Kesatuan Website Using the System Usability Scale (SUS)

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to conduct a thorough user experience assessment of the IBI Kesatuan website, leveraging the System Usability Scale (SUS) as a key evaluative tool. The IBI Kesatuan website serves as a vital resource for users seeking information about the Institute of Business and Informatics Kesatuan, located in Bogor, Indonesia. The research aims to identify the website's usability by examining user interactions and satisfaction levels.

The project employs a structured methodology, utilizing the SUS questionnaire, which consists of ten targeted questions designed to gauge the website's effectiveness, ease of use, and overall user satisfaction. To ensure the validity and reliability of the findings, expert reviews and statistical tests, such as the Product-Moment coefficient and Cronbach's Alpha test, are conducted. A Cronbach's Alpha score within the range of 0.7-0.9 indicates a high level of reliability for the questionnaire.

The assessment reveals an overall SUS score of 77, categorizing the IBI Kesatuan website as having "good" usability. This score not only reflects positive user experiences but also highlights specific strengths and areas for improvement in the websiteâ€™s design, content, and navigation.

This study emphasizes the importance of user experience in web design and aims to provide actionable insights that can be utilized to enhance the IBI Kesatuan website. By addressing user feedback, the website can be refined to better serve its audience, ultimately fostering greater satisfaction and engagement among current and prospective users.
